An API base. Developed as requirement for the 2nd module of the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp at IGTI

# what i learned
* Use of fileSystem in Node.JS
* Practice of array methods in JavaScript
* Basic manipulation of JSON files

# how it works
In the first use, it will generate the files for each state and list in an array all the cities that belong to that state.
Then, it will print:
  * countCities('UF') => For UF, you should enter the state initials and, then, it will print how many cities the state has;
  * top5(citiesAndStatesTabulation) => prints the 5 states with more cities;
  * bottom5(citiesAndStatesTabulation) => prints the 5 states with least cities;
  * biggestCitiesForEachState() => prints the city with the longest name for each state;
  * biggestCityAmongStates() => prints the city with the longest name in Brazil;
  * smallesttCityAmongStates() => print the city with the shortest name in Brazil;
